            Football (Soccer) isn't just a sport; it's a global culture. It unifies people through shared language
            and passion, acting as a significant part of national and local identity, influencing daily life, media, and
            even fashion.

            From the bustling streets of São Paulo to the historic towns of Germany, football isn't just a pastime, it's part of the social fabric. Countries with a high number of stadiums per capita show a
            commitment to keeping the sport accessible and central to community life, making stadiums a modern cultural landmark.

        <p class="text-center max-w-4xl">            
            When you think of European Football, you think of massive stadiums with high ticket prices. On the other hand, countries in South America
            often prioritise accessibility. Even in the largest stadiums, tickets remain affordable, ensuring that football remains a shared cultural experience, not a privilege for a few.

            Why does Faroe Islands have so many football stadiums for such a small place? Also, Why isnt the most popular stadium
            in the world, Santiago Bernabeu on there?

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed flex-grow">
                    In the Faroe Islands, the stadium is more than a venue,
                    it's the beating heart of the community. Here, football transcends sport,
                    becoming a weekly ritual that brings neighbors together. Every match is a pilgrimage,
                    every seat filled with familiar faces. These modest cathedrals prove that passion
                    isn't measured in capacity, but in the unwavering devotion of those who gather.

                    Additionally, the department has invested large amounts of money into building stable stadiums that can withstand the conditions of the islands.

                    Almost every town and village will have a pitch. Football is their culture.

                    The Santiago Bernabéu stands as a monument to football's global reach, a
                    cathedral of concrete and steel where 80,000 worshippers gather in unified devotion.
                    This isn't just a stadium; it's a pilgrimage site that has witnessed generations of
                    faithful fans. From legendary Champions League nights to historic El Clásicos, the
                    Bernabéu represents football's power to unite millions under one roof, creating moments
                    that echo through history.

                    True devotion is measured not just by the size of the cathedral, but by how faithfully its congregation returns.
                    Week after week, match after match, millions of fans make their pilgrimage to these modern temples.
                    The numbers tell a compelling story: stadiums like Signal Iduna Park and Old Trafford consistently
                    fill to 99% capacity, with over 70,000 faithful attendees every single match day.

                    When Boca Juniors' La Bombonera exceeds 100% capacity, with more pilgrims than seats available,
                    we witness something profound: a cultural force so widespread, such that the football stadium itself cannot hold everyone!
                    These stadiums are sacred spaces where communities gather, identities are forged, and memories are made.
